**Data & Prediction Details:**

This file contains a sample of predictions for **January 2025**.

**Training data includes:**
- December 2024
- November 2024
- October 2024
- January 2024

**Prediction logic:**
- Predictions are made every 10 minutes for 1 hour ahead.
- Each prediction is done per cluster (H3 cell), only if the cluster:
  - had at least one ride request in the previous hour, OR
  - had at least one ride request in the last 7 weeks during the particular timewindow, OR
  - had at least one ride in the same calendar month a year ago.

**Model retraining frequency:**  
Planned once per month (preferably during the night of the 1st day).

    **Model quality (train):**
        MAE: 0.516
        RMSE: 0.824
        R²: 0.647

    On average, the model is off by 0.52 ride requests;
    RMSE is slightly higher than MAE;
    The model explains about 65% of the variance in the data (a good sign of fit);

    **Model quality (validation):**
        MAE: 0.626
        RMSE: 1.053
        R²: 0.638
        
    Error increased slightly to 0.63 rides;
    Higher due to potential outliers, but not dramatically worse;
    Still explains about 64% of the variance (generalizes well to unseen data);

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
R² (Coefficient of Determination)

Conclusion:
The model generalizes well - validation metrics are close to training metrics, indicating no overfitting;
An average prediction error of less than 1 ride per H3-time slot is very accurate for real-world taxi demand;
The difference between RMSE and MAE suggests the model is somewhat affected by outliers, but overall remains stable;
The R² values above 0.6 indicate that the model captures a meaningful portion of the signal;
